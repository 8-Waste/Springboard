#### Data Wrangling
Small projects oriented to display skills for collecting and manipulating data. The folder includes practice manipulating JSON data, pulling data from a Database, and using a REST API.
<br/>
<br/>
#### EDA
Small projects which use statistical inference tests to determine significant differences and correlations while exploring datasets.
<br/>
<br/>
#### Machine Learning
Small projects related to various standard ML algorithms. Projects invlove preprocessing steps, hyperparameter tuning, and validations needed specific for the algorithm being used in the project. Clustering, Naive Bayes, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Deep Neural Network algorithms are practiced in this section.

#### Small Projects
In this section there are a couple of fully worked through projects. Similar to the capstones but significantly smaller and less thorough. They are designed to be quick to read through but still display the necessary skillset of a data scientist.
